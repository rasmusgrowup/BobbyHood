# Repository for the adventure game Bobby Hood

This is the repository for the adventure game Booby Hood â€” a clone of the incredibly boring game World Of Zuul.

## Workflow

Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date.

```
$ git pull
```

Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch :
```
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
Don't include the brackets. The command should be: git checkout -b awesome_branch

Push the branch on github :

```
$ git push -u origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
```
